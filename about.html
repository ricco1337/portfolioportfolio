<!-- About Paragraph -->
<h2 class='text-center mt-5'>Hello! Im Ricco!</h2>
<p class='text-center about-paragraph'>I am a 23 year old front-end web developer.<br>
I became interested in coding when i was a small child, at a time in my life when i was younger my mother and i lived with my grandparents. My grandfather owned his own company developing programs for small businesses and inturn i was i was captivated at a young age with programming and technology in general. <br>
As I grew older my hobbies changed and I went off to school to become a orthdontist, seeing as it wasnt what i was truly looking for, i searched for other alternative careers, and coding was one of them!
<!-- <br>
I was self teaching myself anyway i could, but lacked structure and discipline, so i signed up for a coding bootcamp called DevMountain all the way in Provo, Utah. It was a 3 month full immersive course, 9am - 12pm was lecture, then 12:30pm - 5pm was projects. 3 months go by and i graduate from DevMountain, i come back home to find my grandfather was re-diagnosed with cancer and was weak from chemo therapy. For the last 6 months i was a full time care giver to my grandfather and helped around the house, took him to treatmeant and helped my grandmother with anything that she needed. Coding became second after everything and i didnt have much time to sit down and code.
<br>
My grandfather is doing expectionally well now, to the point where my help isnt as needed and so here i am. All the built up urges to code are finally being poured out in some of my recent projects as you can see in the porfolio section.

Thanks for reading! -->

<h1 class='text-center clothing-brand' >'00110011' Clothing Brand</h1>
<p class='text-center mt-3 hobby-paragraph'>One of my hobbies outside of writing code is fashion! I run a small clothing brand '00110011' formely known as "DVLPR". It used to be based around a streetwear style for developers. But seeing as it is a really niche market, i decided to switch it to '00110011'. Now it is more centered around japanese anime culture.</P>
<p class='text-center mt-4'>Here are some of the clothing!</p>
